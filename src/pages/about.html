        <p>The word proximo comes from a Latin proxim≈ç, which means &laquo;on the next.&raquo; In this sense,
            &laquo;proximo&raquo; stands for something that will happen shortly. The mindset behind
            <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> is similar&mdash;it&apos;s a tool that helps one prepare for what is
            coming soon.
        </p>
        <p>One hundred years ago, people didn&apos;t earn much and didn&apos;t have a lot of spending categories. They
            approached their money flow in a straight forward way: when they received their weekly $20, they just
            estimated how they will spend this money on the following week. The key thing is&mdash;they were thinking
            about the future period.</p>
        <p>Nowadays we earn more, and we have much more spending categories. Mortgage, credits, Netflix, Spotify,
            cellular, kids&apos; school, gas, birthday parties, car service&mdash;you need to keep thinking about all
            that almost all the time. However hard you try, once in a while you arrive at a predictable expense
            unprepared. It is not easy to enjoy life keeping in mind every future payment, hoping that nothing will
            disrupt your checking account balance out of a sudden.</p>
        <p>This is why today more people try to keep track of their personal finances by keeping family books and
            categorizing expenses. Most online banks and many financial websites help us categorize our expenses by
            showing how we spent in the past. The critical thing here, they try to keep us focused on the past. They
            make it look like we need to train our willpower if we want to fit our expenses in their categories in the
            future.</p>
        <p>Has this kind of budgeting helped you to keep track of your finances? Not so much. Same with me. For me it
            was boring, first to set up the budgets, then keep track of them, and every month learn that some of
            the budgets were exceeded. Boring and frustrating. I&apos;ve spent years trying to figure out what was wrong
            (and the banks kept me thinking that it&apos;s my money habits).</p>
        <p>From one perspective, <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> has the same goal as those other tools&mdash;to help you
            organize
            your money flow.</p>
        <p>From another perspective, <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> keeps you focused on your future. And by going through
            this
            exercise, you become mindful of your money. <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> shows you all the dozens of your
            regular
            payments at a glance. It shows you how your accounts might look like after all the payments are executed, at
            any given point in time in the next 12 months. This way, you precisely see how much you can put into your
            401(k) or savings account, how much Netflix affects your budget, whether to pay off those phones now or keep
            paying monthly, whether you will have saved enough for that trip.</p>
        <p>My name is Shavkat Aynurin, and I have created <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> from the ground up. At this moment,
            <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> is at a super-early stage. I&apos;m looking for resources to help me continue
            development. For now, you can enjoy <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> for free. I only ask you to provide your true
            and sincere feedback so I can make <proximo>PROXIMO</proximo> even more helpful. It has saved me thousands
            already, and I want it to do the same for you.</p>
